# PhotoGallery Component

## Project notes:
- I used React & ES6 to create the component, using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get started
- I used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) & [ReactTestUtils](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html) for my tests
- I used [react-swipeable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable) to allow for swiping through photos. You can also click through the photos to progress.
- I tried to handle as many edge cases as possible, including no photos, empty photo objects, empty photo urls, empty captions, etc.

## Running the project:
- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Run the project with `yarn start` and go to `localhost:3000
- Run the tests with `yarn test`
